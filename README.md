## Challenge 001

#### I'd like you to develop a Vue frontend that will use the data from this API   

https://gitlab.com/Kjir/zueri-wie-neu-sample

#### What I expect to see
- a list of messages that allows you to click on a single message to see more details
- sort the list
- filter the list
- it's up to you to choose what to display on the list and which filters to offer

#### After the list, I would like to see
- a page and form to create a new message and save it through the API
